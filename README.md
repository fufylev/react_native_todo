## React Native Todo App
This is my second React Native project where I develope a simple TODO app with these various features but not limited to:
* hooks
* styles
* forms
* list (FlatList)
* wrapper components (HOC) for Text and Button elements
* error handlers (Alert)
* scroll
* constants
* modal window
* work with images (Image)
* icons
* reducer and context
* server work
* use the Context instead of Redux

### Installation
Clone this [repository](https://github.com/fufylev/react_native_todo)


First - you must install the globally [expo](https://expo.io/)
```
npm install expo-cli --global
```

To start an App run this in terminal:
```
cd react_native_todo
npm install
expo start
```

You must have an "expo" application on your mobile device in order to see how this app works. Once the app has started in your browser (bandler on http://localhost:19002/ will appear) just scan the QR code in the bootom left coner by using your camera on "iOS" or directly from Expo App on "Android". Alternatively,  you may use either an iOS or an Android simulators if you have them installed on your computer
