## This is my first React Native project where I develope a simple TODO app with various features

##
### Installation
Clone this [repository](https://github.com/fufylev/react_native_todo)


First you must install [expo](https://expo.io/)
```
npm install expo-cli --global
```

Second
```
cd react_native_todo
npm install
expo start
```

You must have an "expo" application on your mobile device in order to see how this app works
