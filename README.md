## React Native Todo App
This is my second React Native project where I develope a simple TODO app with these various features but not limited to:
* hooks only
* styles
* forms
* list (FlatList)
* wrapper components (HOC) for Text and Button elements
* error handlers (Alert)
* scroll
* constants
* modal window
* work with images (Image)
* icons
* reducer and context
* server work
* use the Context instead of Redux
